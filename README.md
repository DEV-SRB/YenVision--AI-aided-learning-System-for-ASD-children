# YenVision - AI-aided Learning System for ASD Children

## Introduction
YenVision is an AI-aided learning system designed to support children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in their educational journey. The project aims to provide tailored educational aids and address the lack of professional assistance available.

## Project Description
**Yen Vision - AI Aided Learning System | Python, Keras/TensorFlow, OpenCV, TkInter** (May 2024)
- Developed a three-phase ASD support project involving accurate diagnosis, tailored intervention plans, and facial expression recognition.
- Utilized Keras, TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for machine learning and facial emotion recognition.
- Implemented a Tkinter-based front-end interface.
- Successfully enhanced communication and social skills in children with ASD.

## System Models
1. **Hardware Model:**
   - Developed with IoT and embedded C coding.
   - Utilizes push buttons and RFID cards.
   - Designed to provide interactive learning experiences through hardware-based activities.

2. **Software Model:**
   - Compare and credit-based system for children to understand emotions.
   - Hosted on GitHub for easy access and collaboration.
   - Helps children recognize and differentiate various emotions.

3. **Computer Vision Model:**
   - Evaluates the child's understanding of emotions.
   - Uses computer vision to assess the ability to mimic emotions.
   - Enhances the learning experience by providing visual feedback.
